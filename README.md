<h1>Sales Forecasting</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Time Series Analysis is a method for examining time series data in order to extract significant statistics
including forecasting, monitoring or even feedback and other characteristics of the data. It plays an
important role in many fields such as stock market, business, exchange, weather, electricity demand,
usage and cost of products like gasoline, electricity etc.
Time Series Analysis for predicting future values has been a major topic since a few years ago.
Historically, Time Series Analysis has been around for centuries and its evidence can be seen in the field
of astronomy, it was used to study movements of planets and the sun in old times. But now in modern
times, it is used in practically every field, from day to day business issues to complicated scientific
research.
Time Series Analysis has different types, such as Descriptive analysis in which we determine trend or
pattern in a time series using graphs and other tools, Spectral analysis aims to separate periodic or
cyclical component in time series, Forecasting referred to business sales prediction and stock market
and Intervention analysis to determine if an event can lead to change in time series.
Time Series Forecasting is an important part of Machine Learning. It uses different technologies such as
Artificial Neural Networks, Machine Learning, support vector machines and Markov models etc. The
important advantage of Time Series Analysis is that it can be used to understand past as well as predict
future. Thus sales forecasting can be very useful for a Business. Firms or Companies focus on sales for
good reason. Companies should grow their sales in order to exist in the market. Therefore, it becomes a
point of prime importance for a business to forecast where it thinks sales are heading in the future, this
will not only help a company in managing and tracking sales but also help in making important decisions
at the right time.
In our final year project, we similarly perform a Time Series Analysis on a Business Data by using Artificial
Intelligence models and predict Sales in the future.</p>

<h2>Aim</h2>
The aim of this project is basically to design a model which will predict future sales values of a
business based on historical data. Showing complete analysis of each category on monthly and yearly
basis, to assure which month or year will be good for the business
